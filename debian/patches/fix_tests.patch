Description: Ignore test results due to packaging being too strict
 Python packaging is intended to use valid (from a Python PEP definition)
 version numbers.  Resolvelib has a broader set of requirements so as of
 python-packaging 22.0, it causes resolvelib test failures that are false
 positives.  This at least avoids those errors pending upstream resolution of
 the issue.
